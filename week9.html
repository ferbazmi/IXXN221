  <h3>WEEK NINE</h3>
  Lets have a quick recap about the week before hand in :')

    <p>This is what I started with after the presentation.</p>

    <p>In this iteration I did a lot of re-alignment using the Figma grids, looking at my brief I completely forgot about the bookmark page so I added that in as well. The biggest problem that I had was with the landing page, first of all the layout was not good and I was trying lots of ways to fill up space on the page but nothing was working. In the end it made sense for the landing page to be the blog instead of having a separate landing page because it flows more.</p>

   <p>This is the final iteration with the mobile version also included. It makes way more sense without a landing page, but there was some information from the landing page that is needed for the site to make sense to users. I replaced the landing page with a pop up that tells users what the site is about.</p>

  <h4>Reflection</h4>
  <p>This was a difficult assignemnt only because I rushed in the beginning but then once I took a step back and went slower I learnt a lot more and more things caught my eye. But in hindsight, if I were more diligent with the assigment in the beginning I would have to do less work in the long run. </p>
