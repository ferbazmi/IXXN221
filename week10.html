  <h3>WEEK TEN</h3>
  <p>For project 2.2 I decided to use editorX rather than coding it. Firstly because I didnâ€™t think my coding were good enough to complete all the required pages in the timeframe. I followed the lecture for editorX and I found it frustrating from the start, some items seemed like they were locked in a certain area and it was hard to move them around. Another problem I had was the navigation bar settings, the menu was compressed and it took me a lot of time to uncompress it. But the most biggest frustration was the responsiveness of the elements, when moving objects the behaviour of the elements keep changing.</p>
