  <h4>WEEK SIX</h3>
  <h4>Reflection</h4>
  <p>Week 6 was hand in week, looking back on it I should have spent more time working on project one but I had a lack of time due to other commitments. If I were to do this project again I would have spent more time understanding how the venn diagram worked because that was the most confusing part of the assigment for me. I also know that I should have made my journey map more fleshed out by adding more justifications and more details of interactions so it would be easier for other to gain the full sense of how the website would behave. </p>
  <h4>Lecture</h4>
  <P>The most interesting thing that I learnt from this week's lecture was Figma grids, before this class I had no idea that they existed. This will be super benefical to use in my web design project because I can make sure that everything is spaced out and aligned correctly to make the website look clean and sharp which I am trying to achieve. Not only will this help me with Web Design but also with my other interaction design courses.  </P>
