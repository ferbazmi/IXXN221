  <h3>WEEK TWELVE</h3>
  <p>Web Design I is coming to an end this week, looking back it was really interesting learning how to code websites. I enjoyed coding the blog the most because I gotta chance to mess around with what I learnt and apply it any way that I want. Near the end of making my blog I decided it would be better to remake it, down below is what the original blog looked like, every entry was on one page and no elements were responsive. I had fun remaking the pages because I had a better understanding of HTML and CSS so I could structure the pages better.

  <div class="row">
    <img src="img/Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 3.44.13 PM.png" width="50%">
    <img src="img/Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 3.44.40 PM.png" width="50%">
  </div>
  <p>From this course I learnt so much about how to structure elements and I think that I will apply this knowledge for projects in the future to make them look aesthetic but also functional.
    I took this as an elective so I did not allocate as much time as I did for my other assignments but I am pretty happy with the work that I have done and what I have learnt.
