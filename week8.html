  <h3>WEEK EIGHT</h3>
  <h4>Lecture</h4>
  In class we learnt about typography and how it will set the overall tone of our websites, what I found the most interesting were the examples that were shown on the lecture near the end, while each website was easily to read they all conveyed a different mood by using a combination of colour, font choice, size and weight. This had me thinking of my font choices, the message that I want to convey was simple elegance. My rough idea for fonts were clean lines but also something soft and feminine. After looking at font combinations I settled on Playfair Display and Montserrat because I thought that they met the requirements of the website
   
  <h4>Assignment Progress</h4>
  
  <p>We had a draft presentation before we had the real one. If I am being completely honest I thought we had to have the project basically done for this hand in so the night before I tried to do as much as possible and then my plan was afterwards to go back from the low fidelity mock up and fix it up before hand in. When I went to presentation, to my surprise a lot of people had not touched their high fidelity prototype yet so I felt quiet silly. When it was my turn to showcase my work it was a given that it would receive a lot of critical feedback and it was very useful because I had a list of things that were high priority to fix before hand in. But this was a fantastic lesson for me not to rush for draft presentations.</p>
