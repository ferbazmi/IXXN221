  <h3>WEEK ONE</h3>
  <P>In week one we have learnt how to set up an HTML document, Use headers, titles and parapgraphs, as well as inserting photos as seen down below. I am familar with HTML because I did INFO101 last trimester but I had used templates to guide me which limited how creative I could be with my website, this will be a good opportunity to properly learn how to code a website from scratch.</P> 
  <P>What I learnt in this session is how to create personas and empathy maps, it was interesting because I really had to think deeply about every aspect of a user's life, and that can affect how we design our product. This can be applied to web design because when we do our actual project, the scope that we learn today will be an intgral part in our project one as we are doing exactly the same thing but I have a more stronger idea of what to do now. </P>
 <p>This influences me as a web-designer because ever single project that I am involved in will require me to think about clients. I am always designing for a purpose, it is not soley based on aesthics but instead I am focusing on how to make a positive experience for the users.</p>
