  <p>I followed the lecture to create a website using CSS grids but then I went and played around with it further to understand how each element works. I added another section and then went through the procress of editing the elements required to have a fourth section, this helped me retain it in my memory for longer and I have a clearer idea of what to do to customize CSS grids. I feel like CSS grids would be easy to creating the skelton of a website because you can block out multiple sections on one page. The major problem that I had was the padding around the text, I tried a couple of ways but none of them worked for me. </p>

  <p> The in class task was to use Flexbox Froggy, I managaged to complete it but with difficulty. It took me a long time to figure out how to integrate all the types of code required for flex boxes. I did the flexbox task at home, I tried to put flex boxes in CSS grids but that was difficult. I had the correct layout but I was not able to get the boxes to change size when the window was expanded and shrunk.
    During class I also asked for feedback for my project, I was told to add more detail to my venn diagram so I adjusted that according to what the tutor said. </p>
