    <p> In class we had this flex box task to do, the most difficult part of it was to create section one and section two, initially I tried to make a class inside the CSS grid to separate it from the main. The mistake that I made was that I did not do the grid template area properly, I was supposed to have the sections connected with the main. I think that this will be helpful if I make more complicated CSS grid layouts and looking at designs there are some wireframes where it would make sense to use the grids to create the page. This has gotten me to think of my wireframes as simple blocks, rather than seeing them as a page with text and images.</p>

    <p> During the break I sketched out all the wireframes needed, I used Behance to get an idea of how people would typically layout their wireframes. I iterated the wireframes and recreated them on Figma. The one think that I wasn’t sure about was the blog page because it is supposed to have a chill curated look to it but it did not work with any grid style that I created. I talked to Shiv about it and he said that I didn’t have to follow the grid but I would have to justify why I did that in documentation, so what I learnt was that it is good to follow the grid when creating wireframes but there are times where you can stray from the template if there is a certain look that you are trying to achieve. I also did some research on colours and I decided to go with a neutral colour palette to give a clean, simple luxury aesthetic.</p>
